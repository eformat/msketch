# Moment-based quantile sketches for aggregations

This repository contains code for reproducing the experiments in the Moment-based quantile sketches [paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1647-gan.pdf). Please see the [*companion repository*](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/momentsketch) for a more readable implementation of the sketch suitable for experimentation and development. 

The maximum entropy solver and benchmarks can be found in `javamsketch/` directory, see the readme.md there for instructions on how to build and run the code.

The other directories contain supporting files for the paper.
